# Submission Code: `5129972`

## Flow

All team members have a branch they can work on individually, namely
`<X>-branch`, where `X` is the initial of their first name. The `main` branch
will contain the **solution** that will be later turned in.

Note: in case it's required, additional branches can be created, and the
features of `GitLab` (issues, merge requests, etc.) can be used, although
this is not mandatory.
