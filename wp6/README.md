## Submission format

For this work package, the team has decided to implement the following:

1. Exercise 1 (via TinkerCad)
2. Exericse 3 (physical components)

> This exericse was demonstrated with physical components, and the code was
> tested on a physical Arduino board. The submission provides a `plug.sh` script
> to upload the code to the board using the `arduino-cli` tool (optional).
> Furthermore, the TinkerCad workspace and the circuit diagram are provided.
